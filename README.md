# HT32F-Project-Template
Template to use with GNU ARM GCC

Quick template is used for HT32F projects
- Src: user source code files
- Inc: user include header files
- Makefile: there's nothing there, we have common settings in Makefile.include file already, each project only need few lines in Makefile (even the project name will be automatically the sames as your project directory name.
- modules_inc: please select the modules to be compiled, we don't need to compile whole SDK everytime.
