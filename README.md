# HT32F-Project-Template

Quick template can be used for HT32F projects / GNU ARM GCC with 
- Src: user source code files
- Inc: user include header files
- Makefile: there's nothing there, we have common settings in Makefile.include file already, each project only need few lines in Makefile (even the project name will be automatically the sames as your project directory name.
- modules_inc: please select the modules to be compiled, we don't need to compile whole SDK everytime.
